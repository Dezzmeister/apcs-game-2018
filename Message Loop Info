Message Loop information

The Message Loop is a data structure meant for storing various occurences such as the player bumping into something or a game event
such as pausing or the game ending.

Format: "<type>:<specification>"

Types:

interaction: for when the player bumps into something
specification examples: coworker, coffeebean

event: for special game events
specification examples: pause, unpause, win, lose

complete examples:

"interaction:coworker"
"event:pause"

To add a message, use Messenger.addMessage(String s).
To see messages, use Messenger.getMessages() to get an ArrayList<String> representing the messages.
To see if a specific message exists, use Messenger.containsMessage(String message).
To see all messages of a specific type, use Messenger.getOfType(String type) to get an ArrayList<String> of the specifications of 
  all of the messages of that type.

Example:

The messages are:
  ["event:pause","event:unpause","interaction:coffeebean","interaction:coworker","event:lose"]

Messenger.getOfType("event") returns ["pause","unpause","lose"]
Messenger.getOfType("interaction") returns ["coffeebean","coworker"]
Messenger.getOfType("snek kek pek") returns []
